* Replace the uri field with slug.
* What happens if the config is not set?
* Write the use case.
* Try elsewhere on a fresh project.

## Use the slug in another module

* When that is done, then move the incremental slugger to a separate repo or just to dev/Elixir.

## Posts

* Pager.
* Categories.

## Contacts

* Read data from `pages` table.
